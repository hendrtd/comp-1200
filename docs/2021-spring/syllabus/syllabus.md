# Instructional Mode

Auburn University sent the following communication to all faculty on December 29, 2020:

> The spring semester will proceed as scheduled. In an effort to gradually increase campus density, faculty offering face-to-face classes may choose to begin the semester remotely for up to two weeks. Faculty will communicate any changes to their students.

To aid the gradual return to campus, this course will be taught remotely from January 11 through January 24, and will transition to the originally-published modality on January 25, 2021. More information is given below.

## January 11 Through January 24

The instructional mode for this course will be
[*Online Synchronous*](http://auburn.edu/academic/provost/AU_Spring21_Modalities.pdf). 
During the first two weeks, course will be conducted online in its entirety,
and you will not have to be on campus for any part of this course. There will
be optional synchronous online course activities in which you are
encouraged to participate remotely during the scheduled class time.
The details of this are as follows.


- *Lecture meetings*: Each Monday and Wednesday I will hold a live Zoom session during the scheduled lecture time. This live session is optional but encouraged. 

- *Exams and Tests*: Exams and Programming Tests will be given online during scheduled lecture times, and you are required to take each exam and test during this time.

- *Office Hours*: Instructor office hours will be held via Zoom at a set time each week. The specific day/time will be announced on the first day of classes.

- *Lab meetings*: For those of you registered for COMP 1201, your Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) will hold a live Zoom session during your scheduled lab time. Registration for COMP 1201 is optional and participation in the associated live Zoom sessions are also optional.

You are expected to have all the equipment and software needed to be
successful in this course. At a minimum, you must have a computer with a
webcam and microphone, and a broadband Internet connection capable of
installing and reliably running both
[Zoom](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362023-System-requirements-for-Windows-macOS-and-Linux)
and [Honorlock](https://honorlock.com/support/). You must also be able to
install and reliably run the software specific to this course as described
later in this syllabus. If you have needs regarding instructional technology,
you should contact the AU Bookstore at `books@auburn.edu`.

Times for all course events (assignment deadlines, exam times, etc.) will be set in US [Central Time](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/ct). You are responsible for meeting deadlines in Central Time regardless of what your local time zone may be. You may find it helpful to follow the instructions linked [here](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-set-a-time-zone-in-my-user-account-as-a-student/ta-p/414) to have Canvas show deadlines appropriately in your local time zone to avoid any confusion.

## January 25 Through End-Of-Term

The instructional mode for this course will be 
[*Face-to-Face Required*](http://auburn.edu/academic/provost/AU_Spring21_Modalities.pdf). 
In brief, this means that at least half of the contact hours for this course
will involve in-person activities; you will be expected to attend all such
activities and required to attend some. The details of this are as follows.

- *Lecture meetings*: Each Monday and Wednesday I will hold an in-person class meeting during the scheduled lecture time. A maximum attendance of 50% room capacity will be strictly enforced, and a student rotation schedule will be used to ensure an appropriate room occupancy is maintained. You will be informed of this rotation schedule in Canvas, and attendance will be required per this schedule.

- *Exams and Tests*: Exams and Programming Tests will be given online during scheduled lecture times, and you are required to take each exam and test during this time.

- *Office Hours*: Instructor office hours will be held via Zoom at a set time each week. The specific day/time will be announced on the first day of classes.

- *Lab meetings*: For those of you registered for COMP 1201, your Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) will hold a live Zoom session during your scheduled lab time. Registration for COMP 1201 is optional and participation in the associated live Zoom sessions are also optional.



# Course Description

COMP 1200 is designed to introduce computational and algorithmic thinking
applied in the context of problem solving and computer programming, discuss

disciplines, provide opportunities for students to apply engineering processes
to convert raw data into meaningful information, and provide a foundation in
programming for engineering problem solving.

>**Bulletin Description:** Computer programming in a high-level language, with emphasis on use of the computer as a tool for engineering or science.
>
>**Credit Hours:** 2 (LEC)
>
>**Prerequisite:** None
