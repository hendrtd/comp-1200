# Succeeding in This Module

The key to more complex programming structure is the ability to make descisions. We will learn to phrase our decision problems into yes/no questions and represent them through logic variables and expressions.
We will see how the yes/no answers allows us to make choices (selection) about whether to execute our code or not, thus allowing us to break away from the sequential programming structure.

It is important to be proactive and to begin your work early in the module to allow the material to sink in. If you donâ€™t understand something or have a question, it is crucial that you reach out for help sooner rather than later. Ask questions on Discord, engage with the class, and be proactive. These are good strategies for success.

## Module Objectives

- Assess the results of relational and logical operators.
- Use logical variables to access and manipulate array elements.
- Able to write a conditional expression using a relational operator.
- Able to write a compound conditional expression using a logical operator.
- Assess if-else statements and know which block will be executed under which conditions.
- Assess if-elseif-else statements and know which block will be executed under which conditions.
