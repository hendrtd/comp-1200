# Getting Started With Discord

This course uses the [Discord](https://discord.com/) as an optional communication platform.
Discord is an efficient way for you to ask a question and have it answered.
Particularly for a large class, the average time between a question being
asked and it being answered is far shorter than had the question been asked in
an email to the course instructional staff.
