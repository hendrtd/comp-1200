# Getting Started With Honorlock

This course uses the [HonorLock](https://honorlock.com/) proctoring system for
exams. All fees associated with using HonorLock are being paid by Auburn
University this term, so there is no software to purchase or licensing fee for
you to pay.

The following things are required for you to use HonorLock.

- A laptop or desktop computer.
- A working webcam (integrated or external USB device).
- A working microphone (integrated or external USB device).
- [Google Chrome browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/) with the HonorLock extension installed.

For detailed information on HonorLock please read the 
[minimum system requirements](https://honorlock.com/support/) and the information provided
[for students](https://honorlock.com/students/).

Here are recommended best-practices for taking exams with HonorLock.

- Create a [different profile in Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2364824) for taking exams instead of using your normal browsing/work profile.
- Install the HonorLock extension prior to each exam and uninstall it after each exam is over.
- Select a location and time that will help ensure your environment is as quiet and distraction-free as possible to take your exam.
- Ensure you have a stable network connection with sufficient bandwidth before starting your exam.

Be sure to take the practice HonorLock quiz on the following page to ensure
you are familiar with the process that you will be required to use for a real
exam. You may also find the
