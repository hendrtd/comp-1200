# Succeeding in This Module

In this module, you will start writing simple programs. To solve real-life problems by programming, we must be able to store values and perform operations with them. You will also notice that programming in MATLAB follows rigid grammatical rules as all programming languages do. This module will address the syntactic rules regarding variables, numeric expressions, and functions.

It is important to be proactive and to begin your work early in the module to allow the material to sink in. If you donâ€™t understand something or have a question, it is crucial that you reach out for help sooner rather than later. Ask questions on Discord, engage with the class, and be proactive. These are good strategies for success.

## Module Objectives

- Create and use variables in lieu of constants.
- Recognize valid identifiers and built-in MATLAB constants.
- Create numeric expressions with arithmetic operations and variables.
- Assess MATLAB programs on the basis of a good programming style.
- Create reusable MATLAB programs with scripts and functions.
- Recognize the differences between scripts and functions.
- Apply the built-in functions to perform advanced mathematical operations and basic input/output (IO).
- Create one-dimensional row and column arrays.
