# Module Summary

In this module, we have discussed arrays as a data structure. Knowing how to work with arrays will prove useful in this course as you will soon see that almost everything we do in MATLAB will involve some form of arrays. Furthermore, arrays are the basis of matrix algebra in MATLAB, and a good understanding of the topic will be crucial in the study of your discipline.
