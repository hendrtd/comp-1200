# Succeeding in This Module

In this module, we will discuss arrays with as much coverage as we can on the basics of creating, accessing, and manipulating them. We will learn that almost any operations on scalar values can easily be extended to arrays.

It is important to be proactive and to begin your work early in the module to allow the material to sink in. If you donâ€™t understand something or have a question, it is crucial that you reach out for help sooner rather than later. Ask questions on Discord, engage with the class, and be proactive. These are good strategies for success.

## Module Objectives

- Create one-dimensional row and column arrays.
- Use integer or logical variables to access and manipulate array elements.
- Recognize the effects of symbols and keywords, such as colon and end, in the context of arrays.
- Assess the results of element-wise operators on arrays.
- Know how to extend the above array operations into 2D arrays.
