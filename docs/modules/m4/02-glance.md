# Succeeding in This Module

We extend the discussion of decision-making to the repetition programming structure.
We often have to process data sequentially, or sometimes we can solve a problem by guessing a solution first and then improving it following a sequence of instructions.
Although the information we process may change for such problems, the tasks we need to perform do not.
If we can express the state of "problem solved" as a logical expression, we can write a *loop* to perform the task repetitively. 

In this module, we will learn the basic syntax of loop structures, and we will gain insights into the problem-solving skills needed to recognize necessary programming structures and conditions from the problem itself.
We will further take a look at how to utilize MATLAB debugger to fix errors in our code.

It is important to be proactive and to begin your work early in the module to allow the material to sink in. If you donâ€™t understand something or have a question, it is crucial that you reach out for help sooner rather than later. Ask questions on Discord, engage with the class, and be proactive. These are good strategies for success.
