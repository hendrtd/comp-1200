# Succeeding in This Module

We will revisit an earlier zyBook chapter for a quick review of basic input/output operations in MATLAB. However, since zyBook does not discuss file-based IO in detail, the relevant topics will primarily be discussed through lectures. Therefore, in this module, it will be especially important to attend the lectures or watch the recordings. 

It is important to be proactive and to begin your work early in the module to allow the material to sink in. If you donâ€™t understand something or have a question, it is crucial that you reach out for help sooner rather than later. Ask questions on Discord, engage with the class, and be proactive. These are good strategies for success.
